Oculus-SDK-OpenGL-Demo
======================

OpenGL version of OculusRoomTiny Sample enclosed in the Oculus SDK for Windows 0.4.3 Beta

You would find files identically equal to the original version of the Oculus SDK for Windows 0.4.3 Beta, 
except for these solution files:
- Samples\LibOVR_With_Samples_VS2010.sln
- Samples\LibOVR_With_Samples_VS2012.sln
- Samples\LibOVR_With_Samples_VS2013.sln

They have been changed in order to include the new OpenGL project that you could find in this folder: 
- Samples\OculusRoomTinyOGL

With the aim to facilitate readability and comparison to all of you, I tried to keep the same coding style of the D3DX sample (OculusRoomTiny).
